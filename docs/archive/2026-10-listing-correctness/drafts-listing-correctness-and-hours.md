# Draft: listing-correctness-and-hours

## Affected user and ideal state
<!-- Who this output touches (a customer, another programmer, a program or agent consuming it - often more than one) and how each uses it today and will use it after. -->
<!-- IS-n | property of the ideal state: nothing snags, feels odd, regresses, or degrades for them | reason -->
<!-- GAP-n | difference between IS-n and today | reason | closed by todo(s) -->

## Components (topology ledger)
<!-- Lock the SHAPE before depth. One row per top-level component that can succeed or fail independently. -->
<!-- id | outcome (one line) | status: active|deferred | evidence path -->

## Open assumptions (announced defaults)
<!-- Record any default you adopt instead of asking, so the user can veto it at the gate. -->
<!-- assumption | adopted default | rationale | reversible? -->

## Findings (cited - path:lines)

## Decisions (with rationale)

## Scope IN

## Scope OUT (Must NOT have)

## Open questions

## Approval gate
status: plan creation authorized by the user's explicit request to provide the plan; implementation not authorized
Planning scope and decisions are recorded in .omo/plans/listing-correctness-and-hours.md. The plan is the authoritative consolidated ledger. Stack/audience/scale stay unchanged; no new paid dependencies; no live mutation, deployment or schema backfill. Test strategy: TDD for reproduced defects, tests alongside UI changes. High-accuracy review not requested. Read-only Metis completed and reported two gaps: legacy hash compatibility and persisted hours observations. Both were verified against source and incorporated into tasks 3 and 5; no second approval verdict is claimed. Additive internal observation persistence is in scope for future implementation. Execution remains unstarted.
<!-- When exploration is exhausted and unknowns are answered, set status: awaiting-approval. -->
<!-- That durable record is the loop guard: on a later turn read it and resume at the gate instead of re-running exploration. -->
