# Architecture and data controls

## Runtime role and startup assertions

Supabase Auth owns password hashing, password recovery, abuse controls, and
email verification. NabaPresence exchanges only a verified Supabase user
identity for an opaque, HTTP-only application session; it never stores a
password or a Supabase access/refresh token. The server hashes the opaque token
before lookup, binds the resulting user and organisation to the request, and
opens every tenant data operation in a transaction that sets
`app.organisation_id`. PostgreSQL row-level policies then default-deny records
from every other organisation. `lib/server/db.ts` owns this `withTenant`
boundary and does not accept a caller-supplied tenant header.

The application `DATABASE_URL` uses a non-superuser member of
`naba_app_runtime`; `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL` is reserved for migrations and
administrative test setup. `lib/server/startup.ts` verifies the active database
identity, RLS posture, required secrets, and production feature configuration.
`instrumentation.ts` runs `assertProductionSafety` before the production server
accepts traffic, so a superuser or `BYPASSRLS` runtime identity fails closed.
Verified application users are provisioned by the SECURITY DEFINER
`provision_authenticated_user` database function through
`lib/server/provisioning.ts`, without giving the runtime role unrestricted
organisation or user-table privileges. The stable provider subject resolves
the same user and default organisation on every device. Google OAuth is a
separate owner/admin action whose encrypted connection belongs to that
organisation, so application sign-out or a new device session does not remove
the Google connection.

Arbitrary tenant headers are never accepted. Owner/admin, member, viewer,
location access, and publish authority checks happen above the database RLS
boundary.

Two content-free routing tables intentionally sit outside tenant RLS:
`webhook_route` maps a globally unique Google location name to its tenant, and
`organisation_job_route` lets authenticated cron workers enumerate tenant IDs.
They contain no customer content; every follow-on operation immediately enters
`withTenant`.

## Google integration

OAuth uses state, a signed HTTP-only state cookie, PKCE S256, offline access, and
`business.manage`. Access and refresh tokens, Google review resource names, and
Google review IDs are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before persistence; keyed
lookup uses one-way SHA-256 hashes. Discovery uses the Account Management v1 and Business
Information v1 APIs. Reviews and reply operations use the Business Profile v4
surface.

Backfill and reconciliation share one idempotent upsert path. Pub/Sub messages
are verified with Google-signed OIDC audience/issuer claims plus an optional
constant-time deployment token, deduplicated by provider message ID, routed
through a content-free location map, and reconciled against Google before
becoming inbox data. Failed event metadata is retained for at most 30 days and
can be replayed by an authorised operator.

## Three-phase reply mutation and recovery

The model produces a draft only. Structured output is validated against a strict
JSON Schema. A second stage applies deterministic personal-data, promotion,
unsupported-commitment, unsafe-language, location, byte-length, and complaint
checks, followed by semantic evidence verification. A `fail` verdict is a hard
publish block. Human approval is enabled for every new organisation.

Publish idempotency is derived from organisation, review, and reply-body hash.
`lib/server/publishing.ts` implements three explicit phases: persist a `started`
mutation intent, call Google outside the database transaction, then settle the
local reply and append an attempt event. The intent therefore exists durably
before the provider write. Ambiguous failures are kept distinct from
deterministic provider rejection and are never blindly repeated.
`recoverAttempt` reads the provider state first, compares the intended body,
and settles `succeeded`, `not_applied`, or `diverged`.
`lib/server/jobs.ts` claims due retry/recovery work; `app/api/jobs/run/route.ts`
exposes the cron-authenticated worker tick.

## Checkpointed synchronization and workers

`lib/server/reviews.ts` uses a durable `sync_checkpoint` for every backfill,
notification sync, sweep, and reconcile. Page tokens advance only after the
page transaction commits; high-water timestamps drive bounded reconciliation,
and deep sweeps eventually revisit older pages. Provider-deleted reviews are
tombstoned locally and excluded from analytics rather than silently retained.

`lib/server/jobs.ts` drains retryable webhook events, checkpoints, and publish
attempts across the content-free `organisation_job_route`, immediately
re-entering `withTenant` for customer data. `scripts/scheduler.mjs` runs
reconciliation, retention, and jobs ticks. `lib/server/leases.ts` protects each
fleet-wide loop with PostgreSQL advisory locks so overlapping schedulers skip
rather than duplicate work.

## Membership, organisation switching, privacy, and retention

Owners create one-time invitations through `app/api/invitations/route.ts`.
`lib/server/provisioning.ts` validates the invitation and provisions the
verified email/password identity inside the inviting organisation; it does not
create an unrelated tenant. `app/api/session/switch/route.ts` verifies
membership, rotates the session, updates the default organisation, and audits
organisation switching.

Google source payloads, review text, reviewer display names, addresses, and media
links carry an expiry no later than the organisation’s configured window, which
is database-constrained to 30 days. `/api/cron/retention` purges expired raw
content while retaining minimal derived operational metrics. An owner-approved
legal hold from `app/api/legal-holds/route.ts` blocks purge and erasure only for
its selected review. `app/api/privacy/requests/route.ts` implements attributable
access, rectification, erasure, and restriction fulfilment;
`app/api/privacy/export/route.ts` exports only still-retained content.

Disconnect immediately destroys stored OAuth tokens and disables notifications.
External location data is scheduled for deletion within seven days. Audit rows
are append-only by database trigger, and `/api/cron/retention` enforces the
bounded audit-retention policy.

## Naming

The product's display name is NabaPresence (renamed from NabaReview on
2026-07-29). The rename covers the presentation and telemetry layer only:
user-facing copy and metadata, documentation, the `package.json` name, the
OpenTelemetry service name, the structured-log `service` field, and the
`nabapresence.*` metric, tracer, and span-attribute prefixes.

Wire and infrastructure contracts keep their existing names on purpose;
renaming them breaks live installs or local environments for no user value.
Do not "finish" the rename on any of these:

- Cookies `naba_session` and `naba_google_oauth` — renaming signs every user
  out; the `naba` prefix is brand-neutral.
- Database roles `naba_app_runtime`, `naba_app`, and `naba_test_runtime`, the
  `app.*` GUC namespace, and any future `naba:*` advisory-lock keys.
- The CI database `nabareview_test` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- Historical plan and evidence documents under `docs/superpowers/`, which keep
  pre-rename spellings except where they specify a not-yet-implemented metric
  name or user-facing string.

Identifiers already migrated alongside the design-system replacement stay in
their new form (do not rename back): module paths `lib/naba-presence-api.ts`
and `components/naba-presence/`, the compose project `nabapresence-local` with
local database `nabapresence`, the Supabase local project id `nabapresence`,
and harness/bootstrap addresses (`harness-…@nabapresence.test`,
`local-owner@nabapresence.local`).
