# Architecture and data controls

## Runtime role and startup assertions

Supabase Auth owns password hashing, password recovery, abuse controls, and
email verification. NabaPresence exchanges only a verified Supabase user
identity for an opaque, HTTP-only application session; it never stores a
password or a Supabase access/refresh token. The server hashes the opaque token
before lookup, binds the resulting user and organisation to the request, and
opens every tenant data operation in a transaction that sets
`app.organisation_id`. PostgreSQL row-level policies then default-deny records
from every other organisation. `lib/server/db.ts` owns this `withTenant`
boundary and does not accept a caller-supplied tenant header.

The application `DATABASE_URL` uses a non-superuser member of
`naba_app_runtime`; `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL` is reserved for migrations and
administrative test setup. `lib/server/startup.ts` verifies the active database
identity, RLS posture, required secrets, and production feature configuration.
`instrumentation.ts` runs `assertProductionSafety` before the production server
accepts traffic, so a superuser or `BYPASSRLS` runtime identity fails closed.
Verified application users are provisioned by the SECURITY DEFINER
`provision_authenticated_user` database function through
`lib/server/provisioning.ts`, without giving the runtime role unrestricted
organisation or user-table privileges. The stable provider subject resolves
the same user and default organisation on every device. Google OAuth is a
separate owner/admin action whose encrypted connection belongs to that
organisation, so application sign-out or a new device session does not remove
the Google connection.

Arbitrary tenant headers are never accepted. Owner/admin, member, viewer,
location access, and publish authority checks happen above the database RLS
boundary.

Two content-free routing tables intentionally sit outside tenant RLS:
`webhook_route` maps a globally unique Google location name to its tenant, and
`organisation_job_route` lets authenticated cron workers enumerate tenant IDs.
They contain no customer content; every follow-on operation immediately enters
`withTenant`.

## Google integration

OAuth uses state, a signed HTTP-only state cookie, PKCE S256, offline access, and
`business.manage`. Access and refresh tokens, Google review resource names, and
Google review IDs are encrypted with AES-256-GCM before persistence; keyed
lookup uses one-way SHA-256 hashes. Discovery uses the Account Management v1 and Business
Information v1 APIs. Reviews and reply operations use the Business Profile v4
surface.

Backfill and reconciliation share one idempotent upsert path. Pub/Sub messages
are verified with Google-signed OIDC audience/issuer claims plus an optional
constant-time deployment token, deduplicated by provider message ID, routed
through a content-free location map, and reconciled against Google before
becoming inbox data. Failed event metadata is retained for at most 30 days and
can be replayed by an authorised operator.

## Standalone canonical resources and Google publication

NabaPresence is the sole owner of canonical profile, Hours, and Food Menus
data. A tenant-scoped `presence_canonical_resource` row stores each location's
resource payload, optimistic revision, reconciliation hashes, and last
successful reconciliation time. The first load of a resource imports the live
Google value as revision 1; all later edits are explicit NabaPresence CRUD
operations. No venue mapping or external product service is involved.

NabaPresence normalizes its canonical Hours and the live Google Business
Information v1 location hours, hashes both, and classifies baseline-aware drift
as `in_sync`, `core_dirty`, `google_dirty`, or `conflict`.
`hours_sync_attempt` stores the approved canonical revision, source hashes,
update mask, intended public payload, warnings, actor, and provider outcome
before any write occurs.

Hours publication is gated by both the global publish control and the
profile-write capability flag, plus the member's location publish permission.
The approved pins are rechecked against fresh provider reads. Google
`validateOnly` runs first; the real PATCH is single-attempt and followed by a
read-back hash comparison. Ambiguous writes are read before any retry, and an
exact repeat of an already successful approval is idempotent.

## Three-phase reply mutation and recovery

The model produces a draft only. Structured output is validated against a strict
JSON Schema. A second stage applies deterministic personal-data, promotion,
unsupported-commitment, unsafe-language, location, byte-length, and complaint
checks, followed by semantic evidence verification. A `fail` verdict is a hard
publish block. Human approval is enabled for every new organisation.

Publish idempotency is derived from organisation, review, and reply-body hash.
`lib/server/publishing.ts` implements three explicit phases: persist a `started`
mutation intent, call Google outside the database transaction, then settle the
local reply and append an attempt event. The intent therefore exists durably
before the provider write. Ambiguous failures are kept distinct from
deterministic provider rejection and are never blindly repeated.
`recoverAttempt` reads the provider state first, compares the intended body,
and settles `succeeded`, `not_applied`, or `diverged`.
`lib/server/jobs.ts` claims due retry/recovery work; `app/api/jobs/run/route.ts`
exposes the cron-authenticated worker tick.

## Profile and location-content control plane

NabaPresence owns the public venue profile and Food Menus. Profile fields carry
explicit source policy (`bidirectional`, `import_only`, or `google_read_only`);
operators can edit supported canonical fields directly or explicitly import
selected live Google values. Food Menus support hierarchical CRUD for menus,
sections, and items. Publication is a complete-resource replacement: the
operator sees canonical and live Google hierarchies, counts, eligibility, and
source hashes before explicit approval. A Google readback must hash to the
approved canonical resource.

Google Posts, merchant/customer Media, and Place Action links use the same
write discipline: tenant/location permission, capability plus global kill
switch, durable pre-call intent, provider mutation outside the transaction,
and a live readback or list reconciliation. Posts support only Google API
topic types that can be created (`STANDARD`, `EVENT`, `OFFER`). Customer Media keeps author attribution and
takedown links, while only merchant-owned media can be changed. Aggregator-owned
Place Actions remain visible but immutable.

Capability switches gate provider mutations and ingestion, not the visibility
of completed management surfaces. Disabled features render current stored/live
state with a paused-write notice so an operator can distinguish “no data” from
“writes intentionally disabled.”

## Checkpointed synchronization and workers

`lib/server/reviews.ts` uses a durable `sync_checkpoint` for every backfill,
notification sync, sweep, and reconcile. Page tokens advance only after the
page transaction commits; high-water timestamps drive bounded reconciliation,
and deep sweeps eventually revisit older pages. Provider-deleted reviews are
tombstoned locally and excluded from analytics rather than silently retained.

`lib/server/jobs.ts` drains retryable webhook events, checkpoints, and publish
attempts across the content-free `organisation_job_route`, immediately
re-entering `withTenant` for customer data. `scripts/scheduler.mjs` runs
reconciliation, retention, and jobs ticks. `lib/server/leases.ts` protects each
fleet-wide loop with PostgreSQL advisory locks so overlapping schedulers skip
rather than duplicate work.

`/api/sync/presence-resources` performs a separate bounded sweep for Hours,
Profile, Posts, Media, Food Menus, and Place Actions. It selects the least
recently attempted linked locations per tenant, isolates every resource
failure, and records content-free success/error checkpoints. The scheduler
runs this sweep every 15 minutes by default, so reconciliation does not depend
on a user opening the location workspace.

## Membership, organisation switching, privacy, and retention

Owners create one-time invitations through `app/api/invitations/route.ts`.
`lib/server/provisioning.ts` validates the invitation and provisions the
verified email/password identity inside the inviting organisation; it does not
create an unrelated tenant. `app/api/session/switch/route.ts` verifies
membership, rotates the session, updates the default organisation, and audits
organisation switching.

Google source payloads, review text, reviewer display names, addresses, and media
links carry an expiry no later than the organisation’s configured window, which
is database-constrained to 30 days. `/api/cron/retention` purges expired raw
content while retaining minimal derived operational metrics. An owner-approved
legal hold from `app/api/legal-holds/route.ts` blocks purge and erasure only for
its selected review. `app/api/privacy/requests/route.ts` implements attributable
access, rectification, erasure, and restriction fulfilment;
`app/api/privacy/export/route.ts` exports only still-retained content.

Disconnect immediately destroys stored OAuth tokens and disables notifications.
External location data is scheduled for deletion within seven days. Audit rows
are append-only by database trigger, and `/api/cron/retention` enforces the
bounded audit-retention policy.

Canonical profile, Hours, and Food Menus are public operational business data
owned by NabaPresence and retained until the location or organisation is
deleted. Ephemeral live-Google comparison snapshots expire after 30 days;
mutation attempts expire according to the resource policy. Reconciliation
hashes contain no customer content.

Google Business Profile performance rows are non-personal, derived daily
counts. They persist for trend reporting outside the raw-content retention
window and are deleted automatically when their `external_location` is
purged. Dates are stored as Google-reported local calendar dates without
timezone conversion.

Profile and Food Menu comparison payloads and Google Media provider
snapshots expire after 30 days. Posts retain only the authored product record
after their raw provider payload expires. Profile/Hours attempts retain one
year; Posts, Media, Food Menus, and Place Action mutation attempts retain 180
days.

## Naming

The product's display name is NabaPresence (renamed from NabaReview on
2026-07-29). The rename covers the presentation and telemetry layer only:
user-facing copy and metadata, documentation, the `package.json` name, the
OpenTelemetry service name, the structured-log `service` field, and the
`nabapresence.*` metric, tracer, and span-attribute prefixes.

Wire and infrastructure contracts keep their existing names on purpose;
renaming them breaks live installs or local environments for no user value.
Do not "finish" the rename on any of these:

- Cookies `naba_session` and `naba_google_oauth` — renaming signs every user
  out; the `naba` prefix is brand-neutral.
- Database roles `naba_app_runtime`, `naba_app`, and `naba_test_runtime`, the
  `app.*` GUC namespace, and any future `naba:*` advisory-lock keys.
- The CI database `nabareview_test` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- Historical plan and evidence documents under `docs/superpowers/`, which keep
  pre-rename spellings except where they specify a not-yet-implemented metric
  name or user-facing string.

Identifiers already migrated alongside the design-system replacement stay in
their new form (do not rename back): module paths `lib/naba-presence-api.ts`
and `components/naba-presence/`, the compose project `nabapresence-local` with
local database `nabapresence`, the Supabase local project id `nabapresence`,
and harness/bootstrap addresses (`harness-…@nabapresence.test`,
`local-owner@nabapresence.local`).
